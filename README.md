## tarot application

## Description 

The tarot is a pack of playing cards (most commonly numbering 78), used from the mid-15th century in various parts of Europe to play a group of card games. From the late 18th century until the present time the tarot has also found use by mystics and occultists for divination. Each card has a picture and title that represents a specific concept or archetype. The belief in divination associated with Tarot focuses on the prospect that whatever cards are dealt to the participant will be revelatory. It can also be a tool for self reflection, which will be the primary purpose of the app.
